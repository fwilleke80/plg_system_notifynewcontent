# Notify on new content
## Joomla! 5 plugin

### What is it?
This plugin helps keeping your users up to date when you post new content to your Joomla! website by sending each user a notification email.

### What does it do?
On installation, this plugin creates a custom user field "Notify on new content". Users can choose in their profile whether they want to receive an email.

When a new article is published to a certain category (or to one of its child categories), all users that have "Notify on new content" enabled will receive an email.

### Configuration
Go to *Extensions >> Plugins* to configure the plugin. You can e.g. select the category to monitor, and compose the mail subject and body.

### Known issues
* You have to manually set the custom user field "Notify on new content" editable by the users, if you want them to be able to choose.
